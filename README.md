# Transfer-Learning-Image-Search-and-Segmentation
Agenda:

The "Engine" of Search: Strip a pre-trained ResNet to create a Feature Extractor. Reverse Image Search: Build a system that takes a query image and finds the most similar images in a database using Cosine Similarity. Semantic Segmentation: Implement the "Mask" data loading pipeline (handling the resizing trap) and build a simple UNet architecture.

Results:

Accuracy : 0.9776 Precision : 0.9494 Recall : 0.9793 IoU : 0.9308 Dice : 0.9642
